    <p style="font-family:times; color:blue;">
      <b>Arsenal earned an important win in a pulsating London derby against Chelsea to keep themselves in the race for the Premier League top four.</b>
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:times; color:blue;">
    The victory moves the Gunners to within three points of fourth-placed Chelsea and back above Manchester United, who had gone fifth by beating Brighton.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:times; color:blue;">
    Alexandre Lacazette put Arsenal ahead in the 14th minute when he made the most of a poor Hector Bellerin cross with a fine first touch before turning and beating Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga at his near post with a fierce strike.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:times; color:blue;">
    Arsenal's intense pressing hampered Chelsea's ability to play the ball from the back, particularly in the first half, and the Gunners deservedly added a second through captain Laurent Koscielny in the 39th minute.

    <p style="font-family:times; color:blue;">
    Chelsea failed to mark well enough at another set-piece and Koscielny missed a free header but the ball fortuitously looped in off his shoulder.

    <p style="font-family:times; color:blue;">
    Maurizio Sarri's Chelsea struggled to create in the first half but did hit the post on the stroke of half-time through Marcos Alonso's header at a corner.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:times; color:blue;">
    They posed greater threat in the second half but failed to have a shot on target until the 82nd minute as Arsenal's defence, led by the excellent Koscielny, held firm.
